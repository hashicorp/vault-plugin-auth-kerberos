# Vault Plugin: Kerberos Auth Backend

This is a standalone backend plugin for use with [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.github.com/hashicorp/vault).
This plugin allows for users to authenticate with Vault via Kerberos.

## Usage

TODO

```sh
$ vault auth-enable kerberos
Successfully enabled 'kerberos' at 'kerberos'!
```

## Developing

If you wish to work on this plugin, you'll first need
[Go](https://www.golang.org) installed on your machine.

For local dev first make sure Go is properly installed, including
setting up a [GOPATH](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH).
Next, clone this repository into
`$GOPATH/src/github.com/wintoncode/vault-plugin-auth-kerberos`.
You can then download any required build tools by bootstrapping your
environment:

```sh
$ make bootstrap
```

To compile a development version of this plugin, run `make` or `make dev`.
This will put the plugin binary in the `bin` and `$GOPATH/bin` folders. `dev`
mode will only generate the binary for your platform and is faster:

```sh
$ make
$ make dev
```

Put the plugin binary into a location of your choice. This directory
will be specified as the [`plugin_directory`](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/configuration/index.html#plugin_directory)
in the Vault config used to start the server.

```json
...
plugin_directory = "path/to/plugin/directory"
...
```

Start a Vault server with this config file:
```sh
$ vault server -config=path/to/config.json ...
...
```

Once the server is started, register the plugin in the Vault server's [plugin catalog](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/internals/plugins.html#plugin-catalog):

```sh
$ vault write sys/plugins/catalog/kerberos \
        sha_256=<expected SHA256 Hex value of the plugin binary> \
        command="vault-plugin-auth-kerberos"
...
Success! Data written to: sys/plugins/catalog/kerberos
```

Note you should generate a new sha256 checksum if you have made changes
to the plugin. Example using openssl:

```sh
openssl dgst -sha256 $GOPATH/vault-plugin-auth-kerberos
...
SHA256(.../go/bin/vault-plugin-auth-kerberos)= 896c13c0f5305daed381952a128322e02bc28a57d0c862a78cbc2ea66e8c6fa1
```

Enable the auth plugin backend using the Kerberos auth plugin:

```sh
$ vault auth-enable -plugin-name='kerberos' plugin
...

Successfully enabled 'plugin' at 'kerberos'!
```

#### Tests

If you are developing this plugin and want to verify it is still
functioning (and you haven't broken anything else), we recommend
running the tests.

To run the tests, invoke `make test`:

```sh
$ make test
```

You can also specify a `TESTARGS` variable to filter tests like so:

```sh
$ make test TESTARGS='--run=TestConfig'
```
